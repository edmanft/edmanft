Hi, I'm Manuel Eduardo González Lastre and I am a Physics PhD Student at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain. 
I am currently interested in Surface Physics simulations and Computer Vision applied to chemical characterization and identification.

Previously, I worked with Carlos Sánchez Munoz on Quantum Metrology. My research was focused on quantum parameter estimation on systems of interest for quantum optics applications, where we combined formal quantum calculations and Deep Learning.

Looking for groups to perform doctoral stays during my phd.
